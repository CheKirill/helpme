    Note: clownfish is not suitable for voice changing.
        It works fine in test calls, but causes horrible lags in real calls.

Recording:
    Skype - Linux: http://atdot.ch/scr/
    Skype - Windows: http://clownfish-translator.com
    Ekiga - Linux:

        Note: in contrast to skype, SIP's traffic is not encrypted,
            that is why you can record it using wireshark. As well as your ISP.
