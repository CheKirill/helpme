What ABOUT "numeral"? It means a symbol representing a digit
or number as a noun, and it means pertaining to denoting a
number as an adjective. In both cases it's about how a number
is written, rather than how it's handled.

numeric = consisting entirely of numbers ("a numeric ID")
numerical = involving numbers ("some numerical process")
numeral = the written form of a single digit (e.g. 1 or one)
digital = technically means numerical, but more commonly taken to mean
"associated with computers"
digit = the symbols used to represent numbers (i.e. the symbols 0, 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), though it's also valid to refer to the digits
of non-written numbers, e.g. "the third digit of my secret code is 4"
(and this example phrase also implies that said code is numeric, else
you'd say "third character" or (not really correctly) "third letter")
digit also = finger or thumb, but this is less common
