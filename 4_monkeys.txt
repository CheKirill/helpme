4 monkeys in a room. In the center of the room is a tall pole with a
bunch of bananas suspended from the top. One of the four monkeys
scampers up the pole and grabs the bananas. Just as he does, he is
hit with a torrent of cold water from an overhead shower. He runs
like hell back down the pole without the bananas. Eventually, the
other three try it with the same outcome. Finally, they just sit and
don’t even try again. To hell with the damn bananas. But then, they
remove one of the four monkeys and replace him with a new one. The
new monkey enters the room, spots the bananas and decides to go for
it. Just as he is about to scamper up the pole, the other three reach
out and drag him back down. After a while, he gets the message. There
is something wrong, bad or evil that happens if you go after those
bananas. So, they kept replacing an existing monkey with a new one
and each time, none of the new monkeys ever made it to the top. They
each got the same message. Don’t climb that pole. None of them knew
exactly why they shouldn’t climb the pole, they just knew not to.
They all respected the well established precedent. EVEN AFTER THE
SHOWER WAS REMOVED!
